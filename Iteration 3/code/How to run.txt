Instructions on playing the game

Starting the game------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------||
	1. First select the game options.
		BUG NOTE: The 2 player mode will work, but only if you do not start in the top left corner at the moment.

Playing the game-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------||
	1. Click on a piece in the bottom to select it.
	2. Click on a block on the board to see where the piece is going to be placed.
		a. Move this placed piece with the WASD keys, or click the 'Left', 'Right', 'Up', or 'Down' buttons.
			You can also move the piece by clicking around more
		b. Rotate this placed piece with the q and e keys, or click the 'CW' and 'CCW' buttons to rotate it.
			BUG NOTE: After placing the initial piece, the key input stops working at the moment for moving and rotating the selected piece.
	3. Click the place button when your piece is where you want it.
	4. BUG NOTE: Occasionally the AI does not start taking turns because of a bug with finding a place to lay a piece
		The game has to be restarted to fix this and get the AI to start taking turns again.
